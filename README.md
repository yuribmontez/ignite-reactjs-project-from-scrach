# 💻 About

The project aims to study and develop an application in ReactJS with NextJS for listing blog posts.

The app was developed applying the concepts of Static Site Generation (SSG) and using Prismic CMS for adding and managing the content of posts.

<!-- As a complementary challenge, comments section was added using Utterances, access to Preview Prismic CMS posts, navigation control inside the post to go to the next / previous and addition of tag with data from when the post was last edited. -->


The project was developed as a challenge for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)'s Ignite module.
