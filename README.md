# üíª About

The project aims to study and develop an application in ReactJS with NextJS for listing blog posts.

The app was developed applying the concepts of Static Site Generation (SSG) and using Prismic CMS for adding and managing the content of posts.

As a complementary challenge, the following changes were added:
- Data from when the post was last edited;
- Comments section using Utterances;
- Access to preview Prismic CMS posts;
- Navigation control inside the post page to go to the next/previous posts.


The project was developed as a challenge for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)'s Ignite module.

You can check out a working version of the project at [spacetraveling](https://spacetraveling-alpha.vercel.app).
